This project implements the REST API of http://dailytvtorrents.org as
a PHP class. If your application is PHP based, you can communicate with the API
through the class.

How to use?

i.e. to get the latest episode of an show as an object.

<?php
 require_once('dtt.class.inc');
 require_once('dtt.exceptions.class.inc);
 
 try {
   $dtt = new DTT();
   $result = $dtt->episode_get_latest('futurama');
 } catch(Exception $e) {
   echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage . "\n";
 }
?>

Warning:

By releasing this code, I don't endorse copyright infringement in any way. My main
interest lies in learning how API's work and what best practices are while implementing
them.
